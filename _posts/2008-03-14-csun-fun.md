I spent most of this week at CSUN. It&#8217;s been fun, I am really happy to finally meet a bunch of people, and to meet new folks. Manning the Mozilla booth is easy: every passerby is a grateful user. A lot of subdued dogs.

**Update:** I Made that sound like past tense. I still am at CSUN, and I will be here till tomorrow.
