I spent some time today going over some details for a [Passover Seder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_Seder) that I am helping to organize. I needed to know how much wine is in a standard Manischewitz bottle.

The internet is mainly safe for children, as long as you keep them away from porn and information about Manischewitz.  
I hope schools have updated their blaklisted sites on their web proxies.
