  I still exist. Looks like this blog does too.

  It has been almost 2 years since I joined Mozilla&#8217;s accessibility team. I haven&#8217;t been posting much, but it has been a fantastic and prolific period. We now have a great <a title="Accessibility features in Firefox on Android on Mozilla Hacks blog" href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/10/accessibility-features-in-firefox-on-android/">accessible Firefox for Android</a>, with new features coming down the line every week. More recently, I have been working on making Firefox OS usable by blind folks. <a title="Link to Marco's blog post" href="http://www.marcozehe.de/2013/07/19/small-demo-video-about-firefox-os-accessibility/">Marco made a great demo</a> of the little bit we have to show for it.

  The internet changes very quickly. When I first set up this blog, I hardly knew anyone personally who published any kind of personal update online. Today, I am flooded with everyone&#8217;s life details. This has made me a bit of an online recluse. But I am actually just lazy, and I should post more.
