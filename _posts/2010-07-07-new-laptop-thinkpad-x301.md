Do you know how sometimes there is something old at the back of your fridge that you are scared to take out because it probably smells super bad? And you know how it doesn&#8217;t get any better with time as you think &#8220;if it wasn&#8217;t nasty last month, it has to be nasty now!&#8221;.  
That is sometimes how I feel about my blog, if last month I didn&#8217;t blog in a long time, today I didn&#8217;t blog in a really really long time! So I am probably officially not a blogger any more.  
I still owe some obligatory posts, specifically about [my day job](http://collabora.co.uk "Collabora Ltd."), and about the fact that <img class="alignnone" title="I am attending GUADEC" src="http://www.guadec.org/img/guadec-oranje.png" alt="" width="80" height="28" /> and giving a prez there.  
But now let&#8217;s talk about my new toy. Did I need it? Probably not. My T400 is a portable workstation that gives me everything I need. But every 2 years or so I decide to splurge on a new machine, and I am happy to say that I have become increasingly satisfied with my choices each time. My T400 refuses to die or become obsolete, it&#8217;s black unimpressive looks doesn&#8217;t allow it to get stolen. But it&#8217;s been 2 years!  
I have been looking at the Thinkpad X series for a while, and debating whether the X201 was ergonomically large enough for full days of work. The X300/X301, priced north of 3k, always seemed obscenely expensive, but I was curious what made it so (is it the whale penis leather exterior?). It&#8217;s been lauded as Lenovo&#8217;s answer to the Macbook Air, but I have seen those in reality, they looked paper thin. The X301 does not look as miraculous, not even in the sales photos.  
One day, while reading the interblogs, I came across a $1,700 discount for the X301. I impulsively clicked &#8220;checkout&#8221; (after clicking &#8220;add 2 year warranty&#8221; and &#8220;add to basket&#8221;). Then came my favorite part about ordering a Thinkpad: the weeks long wait for them to assemble it, ship it, get through customs, and hoping the UPS does not lose it in the back of a truck in rural Wisconsin. After this period, you are sure that the UPS guy is going to deliver pure joy to your doorstep, as this photo suggests:

It&#8217;s a pretty nice machine, everything I liked about my T400 in a reduced package. Large enough to work on, but extremely light. Is it worth the $3,000 price tag? No. $1,300? Yes.  
My favorite feature is not the 128 GB solid state drive, it&#8217;s the fact that the earphone jack is on the side, and not in front like in the T400. The front jack just didn&#8217;t work for me, it was super awkward.  
My biggest disappointed has been the fingerprint reader. It does not work on Linux, what&#8217;s up with that? Are we in 1995? I really looked forward to unlocking my GNOME key ring with my middle finger, that would be so cool.  
OK, enough with this guilty materialistic blogging. Next post will either be about my upcoming GUADEC talk about universal design, my fun happy times working on Telepathy and friends, or Israel&#8217;s rapid decline from nationalist chauvinism to overt fascism.
