It took me a while to like blogs. I first thought that it is where people could publicly park their ego, but slowly I started reading other people&#8217;s blogs, and liking it, and then I noticed that there are people around me that I respect with blogs, finally I remembered that my family in Israel is always trying to drill information about my daily life here, so I figure this is a good way to communicate, be expressive, and polish my writing skills.  
I will admit that this is not my first personal web site, when the web and I were young I constructed a personal shrine in the form of _Eitan&#8217;s Slime Pit_. Since I had no photo of myself in digital form I used a picture of Schwarzenegger in his early days. It was fun, but at some point it didn&#8217;t feel very tasteful anymore, so I took it off.  
Welcome to Monotonous.org, yes mom, I know what monotonous means, it&#8217;s an adjective that I like. I&#8217;ll admit that until Friday I didn&#8217;t know how to pronounce it, [Jon](http://www.tux.org/~lasser/) helped me out with that, and it took some practice.  
I should thank [Jeremy](http://blog.jutley.org/) for hosting this site and helping me out. It is weird to use a computer without root access, it brings back Unix to it&#8217;s early terminal use.
