[Reader View](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages) in Firefox makes reading articles, stories and blog posts enjoyable. It removes the noisy background ads and graphics, and gives you a clean single column optimized for your reading pleasure.  
As of today&#8217;s Nightly build, you will find an extra button in the Reader View toolbar: the Narrate button. Press play in the popup, and you will have the page read out aloud.Â  You are now free to give your eyes a rest, knit, wash dishes, work out, play Candy Crush, whatever.

At Mozilla, we believe [the web must remain open and accessible](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/#principle-02). Accessibility can mean many things. In our accessibility team, we work to make Firefox usable to users with disabilities.  
Disability is not a binary, it is more nuanced than that. We define our users broadly, we don&#8217;t divide them into users with and without disabilities. There can be many reasons why you would choose to click play on that Narrate popup: eye fatigue, multi-tasking, dyslexia, or Angry Birds.  
With features like Narrate, we want to make the web more accessible and convenient for everybody.
