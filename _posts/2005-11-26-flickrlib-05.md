This is a Python library that works with the [Flickr](http://flickr.com) [API](http://flickr.com/services/api/). There are a few other ones out there, like [Beej&#8217;s](http://beej.us/flickr/flickrapi/) and [FlickrClient](http://micampe.it/flickrclient.html). I used both to come up with my own. Unlike the other libraries this one uses XML-RPC, that&#8217;s not necessarily good but I just thought it fit better in to Python since XML-RPC is part of the standard python library. The format that the API functions return is a nested dictionary, it might change later to something more palatable.  
Other features include a streamlined authentication process and an integrated upload method.  
The library currently lacks a custom error class and it is not thread safe, and when I say that I mean it will do crazy stuff if you don&#8217;t put mutex locks around calls to this library.  
Anyway, this whole library came to be because I am working on a Flickr client that I will be releasing shortly. Here is how it works:

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; agent = flickrlib.FlickrAgent(flickr_api_key,flickr_ssecret)
&gt;&gt;&gt; agent.flickr.people.findByUsername(username='amanda')
{u'id': u'35237103548@N01',
 u'nsid': u'35237103548@N01',
 u'text': u'',
 u'type': u'user',
 u'username': [{u'text': u'Amanda', u'type': u'username'}]}
</pre>

You could get it [here]({{ "/files/flickrlib-0.5.tar.gz" | relative_url }}).
