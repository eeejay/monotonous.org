Four years ago, on a snowy February day, Aaron Leventhal huddled in his unheated home and [created](https://accessgarage.wordpress.com/2013/02/09/458/) a Chrome extension called NoCoffee. This extension allows users to experience web content through different lenses of visual impairments*.  
I recently ran across this extension again, and thought it is high-time we ported it to Firefox. Firefox&#8217;s support of WebExtension standards means that this should be trivial. It was! With Aaron&#8217;s permission, I [posted the source to github](https://github.com/eeejay/NoCoffee) and did some tweaking and cleanup.  
You can now [try out the extension in Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nocoffee/)!
