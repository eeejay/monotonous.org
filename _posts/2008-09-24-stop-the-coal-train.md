The United States in some respects has come to terms with it&#8217;s dead-end consumption of fossil fuels. A watershed moment happened a couple of years ago when Bush informed us all that we are &#8220;addicted to oil&#8221;, as if his administration reached that conclusion before the rest of us. Even global warming is not the same politicized issue it was a couple of years ago, today it could be regarded as fact without a partisan chip on the shoulder.  
It is really sickening to watch the resurgence of coal energy, and it&#8217;s labeling as the energy source of the future. It isn&#8217;t. It is amazing that certain [industry](http://www.americaspower.org/ "America's Power") and [interest groups](http://www.futurecoalfuels.org "Future Coal Fuels") could get away with such a [corny mindfuck](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_5OrJVR_Vc "America's Power TV ad on Youtube").

  * **It doesn&#8217;t just warm your house** &#8211; While just over half of the electricity generated in the US is from coal, coal sources account for over 80% of CO2 emissions, the main greenhouse gas. Yes, they talk about clean coal technologies, but as of today that is still [science fiction](http://www.greenpeace.org/seasia/en/asia-energy-revolution/dirty-energy/clean-coal-myth/clean-coal-myths-and-facts "Green Peace - Clean Coal, Myth And Fact").
  * **Extraction methods are environmentally devastating** &#8211; It absolutely amazes me that [mountain top removal](http://www.ilovemountains.org/resources/ "Moutain Top Removal FAQ at ilovemountains.org") is a legitimate practice in the 21st century. The latest administration streamlined the process and relaxed regulations allowing coal companies to fill thousands of miles of waterways with toxic sludge.
  * **It is destroying communities** &#8211; Mountain top removal was developed as a mining technique that negates the need for a large (unionized) workforce. As such, coal-rich communities don&#8217;t get the same employment opportunities as they used to. But they still pay a heavy price in loud blasts, sludge, floods, dried or contaminated wells, etc. Often the homes in these areas are rendered unlivable and people are forced to leave. The mining companies are rarely held accountable for any of this, while families see the price of their home drop to nothing, and their children&#8217;s health compromised. This is happening here, in America. Some of the poorest communities in the states are demonized as being backward, inbred, and unsavable, while mining companies rob them of the little they have on this earth.
  * **It is not renewable** &#8211; When we finally deplete coal, rape our environment, poison our water, and pillage Appalachia, we will remain with the same hippie energy options we face today.

So I decided to do my blogger&#8217;s duty and get the word out, I also added a badge to my site which is very not like me. Sign it!
