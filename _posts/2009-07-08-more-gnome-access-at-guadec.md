Speech recognition is an often overlooked assistive technology on GNOME. His GSOC project, GNOME-Voice-Control, is a good proof of concept to what is possible with available speech recognition technologies like [Sphinx](http://cmusphinx.org "Sphinx web site"). Unlike last night&#8217;s personal demo, the demo during the presentation worked, and received applause.  
There is a lot more work to be done, but Raphael has a lot of enthusiasm and ideas. Now that he has more time on his hands, I hope we get to see more and more compeling features, and perhaps, maybe, have software that would provide full speech control of the desktop.  
Overall, I am very pleased with the accessibility-related talks we had this year. I counted so far [Sandy](http://automorphic.blogspot.com/ "Sandy's blog")&#8216;s UIA talk, [API](http://blogs.igalia.com/apinheiro/ "API's blog")&#8216;s [Cally talk](http://www.grancanariadesktopsummit.org/node/200 "Cally presentation summary"), and Raphael&#8217;s [speech talk](http://www.grancanariadesktopsummit.org/node/214 "Speech recognition talk summary"). There might have even been a few that I missed. This is an improvement from the last GUADEC I was at, when I was the only one with an accessibility-related presentation.
