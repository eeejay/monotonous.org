Haven&#8217;t blogged in a while. Sorry?

### GUADEC 2010

I am going! And more importantly I am presenting. The title is _Accessible by Universal Design: Why I love The iPhone_. Did I provoke you yet? Hope so. In this talk I will show how smug designers with their high sense of aesthetic could be even better (and smugger). I am not racist, some of my best friends are designers.

### Caribou

[It](http://live.gnome.org/Caribou "Caribou wiki page") will be in GNOME 3.0. I recently took over maintainership, which basically means cutting releases, making sure it&#8217;s translatable, accessible, packageable, and generally keeping up with the GNOME schedule. There seems to be a good amount of people interested in it, and there is even official funding for it in Spain, so we will be getting some good contributions in the near future.

### iPhone Application

I have one in the app store. Before you accuse me of being a sellout and an Apple fanboy, let me just say that it was an interesting experience, and my motivation was mostly writing for something that everybody has (and it&#8217;s a real thrill). Took the better part of two weekends, [Jenny](http://jennystrip.wordpress.com/about "Jenny's Trip") and I are unveiling it in [Megapolis](http://megapolisfestival.org/blogalogadingdong/ "Megapolis blog") in Baltimore this weekend, if you are in the area you should download it and give it a try. Future versions should have a lot more user-submitted content and work in other areas around the world. Maybe a Maemo and Android version too&#8230;

### Work

It&#8217;s fun and interesting, hope to give an update on that once I actually have something to show.
