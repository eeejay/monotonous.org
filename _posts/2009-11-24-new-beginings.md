The month of November has been a month of news. That is new in plural, not information about recent and important events.

### New Home and house mates

We all moved together into a new green house, with a new chore wheel and a new pergo floor. It&#8217;s quite fantastic, I just need to update my mailing address across the board for the third time in 6 months. My house mates are all sorts of fun, and cooler than peppermint patties.

### New E-mail

After 15 years with the same e-mail address, I decided it is time to graduate from my dad&#8217;s domain name into my own. My new address is eitan at this-blogs-domain-name.

### New Bank Account

I have been getting tired of Bank Of America&#8217;s mediocreness, especially when it comes to online services, so I started transfering to BECU, a local credit union.

### New Bike

I have a new red bicycle. It&#8217;s a real head-turner, which makes me concerned about theft. But I am just going to enjoy it anyway. I have almost completely stopped walking to places since I got it. Capitol Hill is just an 8 minute ride away.
