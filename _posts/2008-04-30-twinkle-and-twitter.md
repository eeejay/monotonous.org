About a week back I downloaded an app for my iPhone called Twinkle. It&#8217;s a Twitter client with two catches: It allows you to geotag posts, and it allows you to take attach photo snaphots of whatever it is you are doing. Both of these features make Twinkle a real great toy. It is a lot of fun browsing the twitters within a one mile radius, and trying to make out from the photos where the picture was taken. It really puts a whole new dimension to social networking.  
The downside is that there is no way to relay this experience to non-iPhone users. So I made a few Yahoo pipes that mash up the photo with the proper twitters. This is my [personal feed](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=67c7356101ecda7e4c351a810ee6dea8&_render=rss&img_height=480&img_width=320&twitter_name=eeejay "Twinkle RSS feed").  
You could create new feeds from my [pipes page](http://pipes.yahoo.com/eeejays_pipes "My Yahoo Pipes").
