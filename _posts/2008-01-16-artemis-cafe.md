Last night I went to a Vanadu dinner, or a Vannadinner. I know what you are all thinking, &#8220;Vanadu? Is that a van full of commuters who go to work at Microsoft every day together and talk on the way about nothing in particular?&#8221;, the answer is yes. Not such a long time ago [I used to work in Redmond too]({{ "/?p=17" | relative_url }}). The absolute best part about this period was the commute in Vanadu. So [Vince](http://unclevinny.wordpress.com) let me know about an upcoming Vanadu social gathering, I was so excited to talk about nothing in particular again. It turned out that I didn&#8217;t really get to idle with the folks I knew since Vanadu has moved on since I left, and found other regulars, but the conversations were just as unimportant as usual, so I was not disappointed.  
The Vanadinner took place in at [Artemis](http://www.artemiscafe.net/) which just opened this fall. The owners, Boris and Oscar, are ex Microsoft employees. And FOVs (Friend Of Vanadu). So it was nice to have it there. It&#8217;s also two blocks from my home. From people were saying the food is lovely, it is a lot of meat and seafood, so I didn&#8217;t really have anything special, but I bet with time they will discover the hidden demographic of vegetarian foodies. But I found solace in their excellent hot totties.
