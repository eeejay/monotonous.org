<img class="alignright" title="Collabora" src="http://planet.collabora.co.uk/images/collabora.png" alt="Collabora" width="154" height="136" /> Before this news gets old, I figured I should mention it in this here bloggy.  
I started working for [Collabora](http://www.collabora.co.uk "Collabora")! I am really happy to be on board, it&#8217;s great to be in company with smart people. I&#8217;m already busy with [Telepathy](http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki "Telepathy wiki page") once again, after a few years break. I&#8217;ll be at the upcoming FOSDEM, and I am looking forward to catch up with my new colleagues.
