As [Will](http://blogs.sun.com/wwalker/) pointed out, the [latest issue of Linux Journal](http://www.linuxjournal.com/issue/167 "Linux Journal March Issue Summary") is focusing on the desktop, with not one, but two articles devoted to desktop accessibility! If I read the contract that I signed hastily right, I keep the copyright for the article, so I could post it [here]({{ "/make-your-application-accessible-with-accerciser/" | relative_url }} "Accerciser article").
