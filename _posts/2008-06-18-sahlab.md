I used to love [sahlab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salep#Beverage "Wikipedia section about sahlab") from a mix when I was in Israel. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t know how to make it until recently. If you are going to be in [Istanbul this summer](http://www.guadec.org), you will probably get the real stuff. Oh, how I envy you.

  * Half a liter of milk.
  * 3 tbs. of corn starch.
  * 2 tbs. sugar.
  * 1 tbs. orange flower or rose water.

Pour milk in saucepan, leaving about a third of a cup out. Use the remaining milk to emulsify the corn starch. Boil the milk in the saucepan with the lid on. When the milk comes to a boil, add the emulsified corn starch, sugar and flower water. Continue stirring on a medium flame until the milk thickens.  
Pour in to cups and garnish with crushed nuts and cinamon.
