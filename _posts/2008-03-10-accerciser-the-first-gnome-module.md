But seriuosly, I just rolled the tarballs for the 1.2.0 release, our second major release. You could get them [here](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/accerciser/1.2/ "Download Accerciser").  
Besides the translation effort, which was awesome, as usual. This release saw plenty of contributions, here is an incomplete list of helpful folks, thank you!
