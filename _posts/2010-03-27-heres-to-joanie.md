One of the most dedicated and passionate GNOME accessibility activists is [Joanie Diggs](http://blog.grain-of-salt.com/ "Joanie's blog"). She is the new Orca maintainer, and a classic example of how a user turns in to an advocate who turns in to a contributor. Besides her paying full time job, in recent years she has had another full time job in the form of Orca web accessibility and bug squashing.  
Joanie has definitely made her mark, and is yet to do a lot more.
