Another [release](http://groups.google.com/group/free-aria/browse_thread/thread/267c3d0a13b018e9# "Release announcement") out the door!  
**Update:** I started migrating tests and creating new tests against the [codetalks collection](http://groups.google.com/group/free-aria/browse_thread/thread/3738cf3c883325d7# "David's announcement"). You could see that git branch [here](http://github.com/eeejay/specular/tree/codetalks_suite "Github branch").
