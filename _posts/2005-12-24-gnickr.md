[<img src="http://gnickr.sourceforge.net/images/gnickr-foot.gif" alt="gnickr" style="float:left;margin:5px;" />](http://gnickr.sourceforge.net "Photo Sharing") I am proud to finally release [gnickr](http://gnickr.sourceforge.net). It has been a pet project for the last few months. After reaching the &#8220;cool enough&#8221; stage I decided to release it, which demanded much more effort then the software itself; I had to deal with packaging documentation and publicity. As for features it is only about half way implemented. And that half is also pretty dirty, so I will need to clean up a bit for this project to stay manageable.  
So what is [gnickr](http://gnickr.sourceforge.net)? Its not any single application. [Gnickr](http://gnickr.sourceforge.net) extends [Gnome](http://www.gnome.org) in a way that allows you to use your favorite [Gnome](http://www.gnome.org) photo editing and management software directly in [Flickr](http://flickr.com).
