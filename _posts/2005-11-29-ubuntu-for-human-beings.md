I was checking the mail room in my work place daily for the past two months waiting for my Ubuntu CDs. They arrived!  
They arrived very late and mushed. But who could complain about something they didn&#8217;t pay for?  
Installing Ubuntu Breezy is sooo painless it picks up all the weird hardware and just works well.
