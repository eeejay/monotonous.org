For the last three years I have had the opportunity to send out a reminder to Mozilla staff that Martin Luther King Jr. Day is coming up, and that U.S. employees get the day off. It has turned into my MLK Day eve ritual. I read his letters, listen to speeches, and then I compose a belabored paragraph about Dr. King with some choice quotes.  
If you didn&#8217;t get a chance to celebrate Dr. King&#8217;s legacy and the movements he was a part of, you still have a chance:

  * Watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1020072/" target="_blank">Selma.</a>
  * Watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1592527/" target="_blank">The Black Power Mixtape</a> (it&#8217;s on Netflix).
  * Read <a href="http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html" target="_blank">A Letter from a Birmingham Jail</a> (it&#8217;s really really good).
  * Listen to his speech <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Qf6x9_MLD0" target="_blank">Beyond Vietnam</a>.
  * Listen to his last speech <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDl84vusXos" target="_blank">I Have Been To The Mountaintop</a>.
