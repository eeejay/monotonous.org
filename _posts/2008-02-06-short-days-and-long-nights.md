I was the fortunate winner of two special things in the last local [JVP](http://jvp.org "Jewish Voice for Peace") benefit auction: Knitting lessons from Wendy, and monthly music mixes from Mike. Although I am an eager learner, I thought crafty Terah might enjoy knitting lessons a lot. So Wendy is teaching Terah to knit. I am closely watching the progress as the stitches are straightening out.

Mike has put his whole heart in to making personal monthly music mixes for me. The first one, _January: Short Days and Long Nights,_ arrived in the mail a week ago. It has been a joy to listen to, I have it mostly on constant loop. Mike put together a diverse collection of music with subtle hints of the disc&#8217;s theme. I put together an internet radio station that plays the mix in a loop for all you out there to enjoy.
