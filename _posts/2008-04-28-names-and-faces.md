It used to be that when you used the [Planet GNOME](http://planet.gnome.org) feed, you would get the faces and and names of the folks who were posting. For some reason this hasn&#8217;t been the case lately. Sometimes I see posts with no author names at all, and I have to click through to see who&#8217;s post it is.  
This is unfortunate, because I rarely remember names, but I always remember faces. And there are a bunch of faces on the planet that I love reading.  
Does anyone know why the hakergotchi and author names dissapeared from the Atom and RSS2 feeds?
