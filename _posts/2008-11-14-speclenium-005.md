I just released [Speclenium]({{ "/specular" | relative_url }} "Specular web site") 0.0.5.  
One of the bigger stuff I worked on was setting up a proper tree diff view that allows the user to grasp quickly how the two accessible object trees differ. So here is an [example page]({{ "/specular/specular/viewdiff/ff3_vs_ie.xml" | relative_url }} "API delta presentation"). It represents the accessible tree differences between Firefox 3 and IE 8 Beta 2. The page they are both rendering is an [ARIAÂ  slider example](http://codetalks.org/source/widgets/slider/pretty-slider-background-images.html "Codetalks ARIA slider example").  
I only tested this with Firefox, so it probably does not yet work on anything else. I also tested it with Orca, NVDA and Fire Vox.  
Let me know what you think!
