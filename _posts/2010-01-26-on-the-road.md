Sitting in JFK&#8217;s Jet Blue terminal, I could run out and catch a train to my grandparents, but it just seems so darn early, and I am not sure if I want to brave NYC just yet.  
Here is a silly badge:  
[![I'm going to FOSDEM, the Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting](http://www.fosdem.org/promo/going-to)](http://www.fosdem.org)  
If you asked me a month ago, I would have said that the next time I get to geek out with European GNOME folks would be in the summer. But it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s next week! I only have a vague picture of who will be there outside of the [Collabora](http://collabora.co.uk) scene, but I am looking forward to seeing folks. I also really wanted to go to the [usability hackfest](http://live.gnome.org/UsabilityProject/London2010 "Hackfest wiki page") later in February, but there is just that many times you could cross the Atlantic in a month (once).  
The accessibility hackfest is coming up! I&#8217;m excited. I hope to have a few moments of clarity when this event is over. It will be useful to have a list of tasks and dates if we want to pull this off again. A special thanks to Stormy, the GNOME board and travel committee for their help in putting this together. I usually spare my pretty little head from logistics and organizing, but it&#8217;s good to take on such a project once in a while.
