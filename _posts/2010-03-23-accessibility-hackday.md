Everyone headed off to hear the CSUN keynote. I am here with Steve Lee looking over my shoulder.  
We had some good discussions today, actually a lot of it. My brain is switching contexts on average every minute, I&#8217;ll try to be more focused and switch tasks every 5 minutes instead.  
I am looking forward to taking testimonies from users we run into and posting it to this here blog.  
Hope others fill in the details on the actual discussions soon, or I will have to.
