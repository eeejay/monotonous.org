A [recent survey](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6063386.stm) by the BBC shows the sentiments towards torture in different countries.

I feel sad that the two countries that I am associated with: Israel and the U.S. are so high on the torture approval list. And between them is Russia which is confidently marching on the path towards authoritarianism.  
I am a privileged citizen among globally oppressive regimes.
