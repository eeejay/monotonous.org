_If you haven&#8217;t done it yet, you should probably start lobbying your local iMax theater to screen the new_ [_A-Team film_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0429493/ "The A-Team Movie on IMDB") _when it comes out later this year._

To put this into perspective, this won&#8217;t be a casual event. It&#8217;s a large conference riddled with many sessions of interest, a huge showroom packed with a milling crowd, 14 GNOME a11y contributors trying to get the most done together in the space of a few days,  and countless hordes of cute (yet unpettable) guide dogs.  
If you plan to attend, make sure to visit the ever-changing [wiki page](http://live.gnome.org/Accessibility/Hackfest2010 "Hackfest Wiki Page").  
I would like to thank sponsors such as the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org "The Mozilla Foundation"), for being a steadfast supporter of FOSS a11y in all it&#8217;s forms, the [Mike](http://twitter.com/Mpaciello) and the [Paciello Group](http://www.paciellogroup.com "The Paciello Group") for help with the venue, and of course the [GNOME Foundation](http://foundation.gnome.org/ "The GNOME Foundation"). The CSUN organizers have also cut us some slack in a largely expensive event, so thank you organizers.  
And thank you [Hylke](http://www.bomahy.nl/hylke/blog/ "Hylke Bons") for the awesome logo.  
More soon.
