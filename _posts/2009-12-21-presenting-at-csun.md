So my talk _How to Make Friends and Remove Access Barriers In Open Source Software  
_ has been accepted for CSUN 2010. The presentation is scheduled for 8 AM, I expect high attendance of dairy farmers, since they will probably be taking their lunch break around that time.  
Here is a short abstract:

> This presentation will consist of two parts. In the first part we will demonstrate the contrasts that exist when developing accessible applications between proprietary platforms and free platforms. In the second part we will become familiar, through real-life examples, with the culture in GNOME, a Free and Open Source desktop environment, and how it provides a conducive atmosphere for accessibility innovation and contribution, by developers, writers, educators, and users.

I am going to have a lot of fun putting together slides and media for this.
