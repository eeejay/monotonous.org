For my own and for other people&#8217;s benefit, here is my recipe.  
Ingredients:

  * 1 kilo garbanzo beans
  * 1 kilo Tahini
  * 1 garlic
  * 2 large lemons
  * 4 tablespoons of crushed cumin seeds
  * Salt to tase

Garbanzo beans should soak overnight in water with a tablespoon of baking soda. Make sure the water is about four fingers higher than the beans, they expand.  
Put the beans in a pot with fresh water and cook for about 2 hours, or 1 if it is a pressure pot. Make sure the beans are easily crushed between two fingers. The softer they are the smoother the hummus will be. Don&#8217;t throw out the water, you will be using it.  
Put the beans in a food processor (they probably won&#8217;t all fit, you&#8217;ll have to do a few loads). When the food processor starts choking add water from the cooking pot.  
When the beans are smoothly processed add the tahini, lemons, garlic, cumin and salt to the mix. Liberally add water from the cooking pot, get the consistency to be more watery than you would like, when it will all cool down it will solidify.  
That&#8217;s it!
