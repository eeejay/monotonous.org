I am trying my best to start a new project on Monday with a clean desk. So I made another [Speclenium]({{ "/specular" | relative_url }}) release.  
This release does not have much new, the big changes are in [pyia]({{ "/pyia/" | relative_url }}), the Python MSAA library, I added the option for unlocalized role names and states. This fixes some bugs when testing on localized desktops.  
Pyia is really nice, if you have any use for MSAA in Windows, and you could use Python, use pyia.
