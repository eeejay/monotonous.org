The first card in this impossibly balanced card house has fallen. The Israeli media is saying that the paramount criticism of the Winograd committee towards Halutz was the haphazard way the army recommended war. I draw immense satisfaction with that conclusion, since that is how I felt about this war from day one: the generals pushed a spineless civilian administration to war.
