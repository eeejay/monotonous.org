I hope this does not turn in to a wartime tradition. After the last Lebanon war, I [posted]({{ "/2007/01/03/shampoo-queen/" | relative_url }} "My earlier post") a rough translation from a song that was featured in Shampoo Queen (or Queen of The Bath), [Hanoch Levin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoch_Levin "Hanoch Levin in Wikipedia")&#8216;s provocative satire about the Israeli consensus surrounding militarism and national schovinism, specifically following the 1967 victory.  
A lot of these themes remain relevant today. Because of the illegal nature of our actions in Gaza, I thought I would share the following song. Please excuse my rough translation:  
**The Ten Commandments**  
_On a sunny and pleasant spring morning  
We all rose as one man  
Strong and invigorated people  
Of good stature and brave  
We rose and we climbed mount Sinai  
Where we received the word of The Lord  
We climbed proud with song and poem  
The word of The Lord to return.  
First conclusion, for security needs  
We tossed to the sky the first commandment  
After that we also tossed the second commandment  
It too, because of the security situation  
After the second, the third came next  
An understood act of a state under siege,  
And this naturally includes  
In the same package the fourth commandment  
The fourth commandment, and the fifth with it  
Because &#8216;If he come to slay thee, forestall by slaying him&#8217;  
And with a similar cause of the struggle for existence  
Will throw the sixth away with urgency  
It was necessary and so justified  
That the seven commandment was tossed too.  
After it the eighth and the ninth with it  
Both for reason of battlefield morale  
And to finish with an even number  
The tenth commandment was sent with the others.  
On a sunny and pleasant spring morning  
We all returned as one man  
Strong and invigorated people  
Of good stature and brave  
Our heads held high  
Our shoulders light  
Filling our lungs with air._  
I found on the internets a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhCYg_A6_p0 "Youtube video about Shampoo Queen") about the Shampoo Queen scandal. It features the song above. If I had all the time in the world, I would have translated it. My favorite quote there comes after a high-school student asks the IDF&#8217;s chief of staff, Bar-Lev, if &#8220;The Queen of The Bath&#8221; has hurt the army&#8217;s morale. Bar-Lev replies &#8220;A week ago I went to an IDF outpost in Sinai and asked the soldiers &#8216;what is your opinion regarding The Queen of The Bath?&#8217; they answered &#8216;Bring the queen, we will give her a bath over here!'&#8221;. I love that quote because it plays so well into Levin&#8217;s critique of a militarized society.
