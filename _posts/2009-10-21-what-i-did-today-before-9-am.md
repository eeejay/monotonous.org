I needed a non-interactive way of generating PDFs from websites. I really liked [Midori](http://software.twotoasts.de/index.php?/pages/midori_summary.html "Midori's Website")&#8216;s output, so I figured doing the same with the [Python WebKitGtk](http://code.google.com/p/pywebkitgtk/ "pywebgtk Google project page") bindings would be easy.  
So I created a tool called [_interwibble_](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=interwibble "Interwibble in the Urban Dictionary"), you could get it from my [github repo](http://github.com/eeejay/interwibble "Interwibble on my github repository").  
There are probably other tools out there already that do the same thing, but I couldn&#8217;t find any.  
This has been something that I have wanted more than a decade ago, when I thought it would be really cool to have a daily newspaper waiting on your printer every morning when you wake up.
