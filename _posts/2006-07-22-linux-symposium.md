I am having fun here at the Linux Symposium with my dad. Plenty of interesting people who are behind things I depend on daily.  
I went to an embedded systems tutorial, my dad came too. We each got a single board computer to learn how such a device could be hacked. My dad, being light years ahead of the rest of the room managed to [brick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricked) the test device before anyone else knew what to do with it.
