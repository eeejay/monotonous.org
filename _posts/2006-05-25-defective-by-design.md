 [<img border="0" align="left" style="margin:5px;float:left;" src="http://static.flickr.com/49/152187734_9e51cb93a8_m_d.jpg" />](http://flickr.com/search/?q=defectivebydesign&z=t) We had a flash anti-DRM protest in front of the Seattle convention center. Bill Gates was giving a talk about Vista&#8217;s DRM features, so we showed up. This protest luanched the [FSF](http://www.fsf.org)&#8216;s campaign called [Defective By Design](http://www.defectivebydesign.org). I&#8217;m glad I took part in it, even if it meant showing up in downtown at 7:30 AM.
