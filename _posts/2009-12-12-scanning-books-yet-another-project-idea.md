While reading Boingboing today, I came across two consecutive posts that made me really itch to do something.  
[<img class="alignnone" title="DIY book scanner" src="http://craphound.com/images/diybookscanner2.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="375" />](http://www.boingboing.net/2009/12/11/homebrew-300-book-sc.html)  
The [first one](http://www.boingboing.net/2009/12/11/homebrew-300-book-sc.html "Boingboing: $300 Homebrew Book Scanner") was about a grad student who posted an instructable for building a $300 book scanner. [The second](http://www.boingboing.net/2009/12/11/riaa-mpaa-and-us-cha.html "Boingboing: RIAA, MPAA and US Chamber of Commerce declare war on blind and disabled people") is how the US Chamber of Commerce is trying to derail the rights of individuals to digitize their own copy of books, typically to an accessible format.  
Does anyone in the Seattle area want to team up and build this? I think it would be a cool service to offer friends and family. Need a book in DAISY or e-book format for your Kindle? Just send it to us with return postage, and we will send it back together with a CD.  
I don&#8217;t see this as strictly an accessibility issue. I am reading Another Country by James Baldwin now. I could not find a digital copy for it to read on my Kindle. Or more correctly, it exists, but I would need to live in Europe to purchase it. Isn&#8217;t that crazy?  
So, who is up for this?
