Off to GUADEC tomorrow! I feel relatively prepared, I shaved and packed 4 US-Europe plug adapters. If you forgot yours, don&#8217;t buy one, you could borrow.

I also prepared [my talk](http://www.guadec.org/index.php/guadec/2010/paper/view/36#). You should come, it&#8217;s on Wednesday at 11:15 AM in the Seville room. It&#8217;s going to be extremelyÂ nontechnical, but I hope you could follow. I don&#8217;t think a single acronym will be mentioned, although I don&#8217;t hold me to that. We will be discussing the software development process, design, things we take for granted every day, and door knobs.
