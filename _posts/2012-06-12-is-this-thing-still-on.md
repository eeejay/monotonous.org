I am in to the second hour of watching Firefox for Android compile, and I thought it would be a good chance to test this blog of mine. It has been relentlessly hacked for over a year until I decided to move it to wordpress.com and be done with it. I need to follow up with progress posts about Firefox mobile accessibility, and fanboy posts about GNOME (it sucks that I am not going to GUADEC this year).
