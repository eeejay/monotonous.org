Tzipi Livni framed the current conflict in Gaza during her address to the Knesset, &#8220;The world is divided between peace-loving moderates, and war-mongering extremists&#8221;.  
On Saturday the moderates carried out a strike that left over 200 dead in less than 5 minutes. The body count is growing, we are past 300 Gazans killed, Saturday and today brought the first two Israeli civilian casualties. The peace-loving moderates vowed not to stop the overwhelming destruction until &#8220;the reality on the ground changes&#8221;.  
Livni continued and said &#8220;We expect the world&#8217;s support for those who fight the free world&#8217;s struggle&#8221;. On this point all agree, Gaza is not part of the free world.  
Dalia Itzik, the Knesset chairperson said &#8220;this is not a time for politics, we must stand behind the army&#8221;. Similar statements were heard across the political spectrum from left to right. Besides a Tel-Aviv minority, the only bitter cries of descent are coming from Palestinian-Israelis. The media has been quick to point it out, and the threat of this fifth column.  
The pattern is familiar, the Israeli street is proud of the IDF&#8217;s potent use of force: The smart bombs, the effective intelligence gathering, and the cool-headed generals. A true Israeli moment. As Gideon Levy wrote &#8220;Operation Cast Lead, it will end with a Kleenex&#8221;. In a country where corruption and incompetence reign supreme in the halls of government, it&#8217;s citizens trust their future in the professional and war-hardened hands of the defense establishment. The IDF had some low-points, but it never stopped being a winning brand. What pride would we have left without it?  
I voted for Labor in &#8217;99, maybe I was foolish. In the last four years I have vowed not to vote for Labor many times, but here is another reason: The few Knesset seats that it will win in the general elections will have been procured with blood.
