As Stormy [mentioned](http://blogs.gnome.org/foundation/2009/08/03/stormys-update-week-of-july-27th/ "GNOME Foundation blog post"), we will be exhibiting at [CSUN](http://csunconference.org "CSUN conference website") this coming March. Besides the opportunity to offer users a free and accessible alternative to proprietary platforms and assistive technologies, we hope to take advantage of the gathering for a GNOME accessibility hackfest.  
CSUN is a great place to meet vendors, users, and other AT developers. I think such an experience would be beneficial for our own AT folks. We often draw inspiration only from the limited resources surrounding us, and don&#8217;t look at the &#8220;state of the art&#8221; products out there that many users depend on daily.  
So, budget permitting, I hope to see as many assisitive technology hackers as possible this March. Still too many unknowns right now, but I hope we will have more details regarding this hackfest soon.
