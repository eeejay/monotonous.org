We just released [Accerciser](http://live.gnome.org/Accerciser) 1.1.5 today.  
The learning curve for making your application accessible has just been made shallower. A long while ago [Peter Parente](http://pithy.tumblr.com) created a plugin for Accerciser that would allow different kinds of validation for target applications, the most common use case is for developers to quickly find potential gaps in their program&#8217;s accessibility. It has been sitting in bugzilla for a long time. This has been a requested feature for a while, and I am super glad we could offer it.  
**Extensible extension**  
This validation plugin is actually extensible in itself with useful test schemas, for now we have only one schema called &#8220;Basic&#8221; which has a random collection of tests. We hope to expand this to different use cases, for example a schema for Orca developers that would help to quickly discover screen reader a11y issues with different applications.
