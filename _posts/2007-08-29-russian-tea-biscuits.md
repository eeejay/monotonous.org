This recipe is my grandmother&#8217;s. These cookies are extremely nostalgic to me. About 10 years ago I asked my grandmother to write down her recipe for me. She would usually use margarine instead of butter. But everything is better with butter right? Anyway, margarine could be substituted if you are vegan or lactose intolerant and would like to make a non-dairy variant, or as we say, [parve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosher_foods).

  * 1 cup of butter
  * 1/2 cup confectioners&#8217; sugar
  * 1 tsp. of vanilla extract
  * 2 1/4 cups of flour
  * 1/4 tsp. of salt
  * 3/4 cup of finely chopped nuts

Chill dough. Roll into 1 inch balls and put in the oven at 325F for 12 minutes. They are ready when they show slight cracks on top, before they brown!
