Can&#8217;t get enough of it. I lurv [Git](http://git-scm.com/ "Git home page").  
If anything is worth doing, it could be done with Git.  
Over the past few weeks I have written pre/post hooks and new Git commands for the most esoteric tasks.  
I think Git overshadows any other achievement that [Linus](http://torvalds-family.blogspot.com/ "Linus's blog") guy ever had. He should stop working on that hobby [kernel](http://www.kernel.org "Linux kernel"), and put more time into Git, I think it has potential.  
I need to migrate this blog to being Git based&#8230;
