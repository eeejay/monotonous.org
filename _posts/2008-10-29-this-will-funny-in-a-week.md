In a week, after Obama wins, I will be happy that someone like Sarah Palin was in the race. McCain often comes off as being a moderate, he does everything to disassociate himself from Bush. But having a running mate like Palin really helps us all remember the fucked up mentality that has dominated public discourse in this country for the last 8 years.  
McCain and Palin today, demanded that the LA Times release a video in which Obama is shown meeting a PLO persona. The PLO is the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. For some reason being sympathetic to Palestinians here in the U.S. is considered hateful or &#8220;anti-Semitic&#8221;.  
As an Israeli and Jewish American I resent McCain&#8217;s manipulations, so do many of my friends. Hopfully next week, when McCain loses, he will look back and understand this mistake.
