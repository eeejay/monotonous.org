It feels like most Open Source meetups I have attended lately have been on the other end of the Atlantic. It will be nice to be in my element, for once. It will also be nice to meet cool localish people. I am planning to train down there and bring my bike. I hope to see you there!  
I&#8217;ll be talking about inclusive design.
