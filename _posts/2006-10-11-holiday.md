I am leaving tomorow with Terah to England to go [narrowboating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrowboat) with my family in the U.K. I am looking forward to seeing my family, especially my two nieces.  
[Gossip-Telepathy](http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki/Gossip) integration has recently picked up pace, and is starting to gain a lot of positive attention. I feel like I am playing a key role in this, and I hope I still will be 12 days later when I return from holiday.
