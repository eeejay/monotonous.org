I have been tagged with multiple memes lately, a I have rudely ignored all of them. No more! What better birthday gift to myself than a blog post. I will now answer these memes with my own. I was tagged by [Marco](http://www.marcozehe.de/ "Marco's Blog") and [Steve](http://eduspaces.net/stevelee/weblog/ "Steve's Blog") with the &#8220;7 things&#8221; thing, and by a couple of Facebook buddies with the &#8220;25 things&#8221; one. So I decided to reply with a &#8220;16 things&#8221; post, which I believe is the average of 7 and 25. I liked [Vince](http://unclevinny.wordpress.com/ "Vince's Blog")&#8216;s idea of using the top tracks in itunes shuffle mode, so I will be doing that. I will also not tag anybody, since this terrible pyramid scheme needs to die.  
Before I begin, if you want to read up on antisemitism on the left, this week The Guardian had some wonderful columns written by lefty U.K. Jews on that topic. One [column](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/feb/04/gaza-jewish-community "As British Jews come under attack, the liberal left must not remain silent") was followed by a [rebuttal](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/feb/04/israelandthepalestinians-gaza "Representing Israel"), but in my opinion both columns complement each other beautifully.
