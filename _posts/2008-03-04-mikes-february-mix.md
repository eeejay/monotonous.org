Mike came out with [another monthly mix]({{ "/2008/02/06/short-days-and-long-nights/" | relative_url }}). He gave it to me last Friday. This time the theme is &#8220;the many shades of love&#8221;. It&#8217;s pretty heavy on the R&B, but also a nicely rounded playlist.  
You could listen to it [here]({{ "/radio/mikegast.pls" | relative_url }} "MP3 Stream").
