Speclenium has come of age&#8230;  
It is now possible to extract pretty interesting comparisons of browser accessibility API implementations.  
Here are a two comparisons between Firefox nightly builds, and Internet Explorer 8 beta 2.  
The comparison view only works on Firefox, I do not dare try it on anything else.

  1. [Mozilla.org](http://www.mozilla.org "The mozilla.org web site") ([comparison]({{ "/specular/specular/viewdiff/mozilla_minefield_ie8.xml" | relative_url }} "Comparison between Minefield and and IE8 of mozilla.org"))
  2. [WAI-ARIA tree example](http://codetalks.org/source/widgets/tree/tree.html "WAI-ARIA tree example") ([comparison]({{ "/specular/specular/viewdiff/tree_minefield_ie8.xml" | relative_url }} "WAI-ARIA tree as exposed by Minefield and Firefox"))

Here is [comparison]({{ "/specular/specular/viewdiff/chrome_ff3_vs_minefield.xml" | relative_url }} "Firefox vs. Minefield browser chrome comparison") of the browser chrome between Firefox 3.0.4 and Firefox nightly.  
I hope you have as much fun comparing as I did!
