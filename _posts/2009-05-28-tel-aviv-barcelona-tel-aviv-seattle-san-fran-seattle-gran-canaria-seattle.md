  I am up and traveling more than usual this summer. Which is great, although I really would like to spend as much time as possible up in the North West before it gets cold and dark again.

  I am now at <a title="UDS Karmic wiki page" href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDSKarmic">UDS</a> Karmic (come say hello!), and it takes a while to explain to folks where I live, and what is up with me. I moved out of my Tel-Aviv apartment last week, and I am couch surfing (thanks Emily!) in Seattle next week, looking for a home. Oh, and once I land in Seattle, I will go right back to the airport and spend the weekend in the Bay Area for a <a title="Jewish Voice for Peace" href="http://jvp.org">JVP</a> conference.

Thanks to the GUADEC travel committee, I will be attending [Gran Canaria](http://grancanariadesktopsummit.org/)! I didn&#8217;t really plan to attend this year, but now that I am, I need to take advantage of the time there to the max. I&#8217;ll be cheering Ara when she presents the [desktop testing project](http://live.gnome.org/DesktopTesting "Desktop Testing GNOME wiki page"), and I will be unofficially unvieling LDTP2. I also want to catch up with folks on the a11y front, there has been some excellent work lateley: D-Bus AT-SPI is taking shape, UIA, Orca is becoming slick, and MouseTrap is neat. There is also plenty of chllanges ahead, namely WebKit and the audio/speech stack. I&#8217;ll also try to make myself as useful as possible to the event organizers.
