I thought I would add subtitles to this short segment from Israeli television. It was filmed in 1991 and it shows [Israel Eldad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Eldad) tour around Jerusalem and debate with [Teddy Kollek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Kollek), Jerusalem&#8217;s mayor for 30 years, and recently deceased at the age of 95. Eldad is an old-school [Revisionist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revisionist_Zionism), the kind you don&#8217;t meet any more, notice the Begin-like waving of the fists. And Kollek is an old-school moderate, the kind that understands simple, and down to earth coexistence.
