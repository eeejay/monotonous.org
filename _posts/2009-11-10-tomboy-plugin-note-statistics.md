It is fun to spend a few hours on small projects that yield immediate results.  
I use Tomboy for essay writing, I often need to know how much I have already put down, so I will typically paste the note into a terminal and run wc on it, or I will paste it in to gedit and use Tools->Document Statistics. So here is a new extension called &#8216;Note Statistics&#8217; and it looks eerily like the gedit tool. Below is a screenshot, screen cast, and git clone URL in that order.  
[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-287" title="notestats" src="{{ "/assets/uploads/2009/11/notestats.png" | relative_url }}" alt="notestats" width="402" height="282" />]({{ "/assets/uploads/2009/11/notestats.png" | relative_url }})
