For a little while now, there has been an apps &#8220;[Show and Tell](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps/ShowAndTells "MozillaWiki: Apps Show and Tell")&#8221; session hosted by Mozilla where app developers could showcase cool things they are working on. Last Friday, I got the opportunity to show off our Screen Reader emulator, and how to use it to test web apps. If you could bear the bad audio, you could watch the session [here](https://vreplay.mozilla.com/replay/showRecordingExternal.html?key=xsQpmgFY3weBU4J "Recorder 11/8 Show and Tell session").
