Early Thursday morning I get on a plane, and start the long and winding journey to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. Two weeks ago I could not not imagine boarding another plane, luckily I have recovered from my previous travel fatigue, and I am excited to go! This would not have been possible without the generous sponsorship from the GNOME foundation. It has to be the greatest community around. I also look forward to meeting the second greatest community &#8211; KDE. It will also be nice to meet new friends and get re-acquainted with old ones.
