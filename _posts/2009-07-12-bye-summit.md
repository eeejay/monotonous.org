I almost didn&#8217;t make it to the desktop summit this year, but I am really glad I did. It has been a great week. I enjoyed catching up with people and complaining about accessibility issues. Being a generally shy person makes it hard to hang out with other introverted computer geeks, but the relaxed beach atmosphere, and the free booze helped.

Ara Pulido gave a [fantastic introduction](http://ubuntutesting.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/my-talk-at-gcds/ "Ara's post about the presentation") to [Mago](http://mago.ubuntu.com "Mago website"). It made me very proud to have taken part in that project, I really hope it takes off with expansive test coverage.  
I am now back in Seattle. In a new home, with a new green towel. Can&#8217;t wait to use it.
