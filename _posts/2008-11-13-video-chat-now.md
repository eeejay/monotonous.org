I have been praying to see video conferencing work on Linux since Quickcam came out with their first camera. We have had [such an application](http://www.gnomemeeting.org/ "Ekiga's web site") in GNOME for a while. But the missing piece has always been, how do I convince Mac and Windows using friends to jump technical through hoops so that they could see my pretty face.  
It seems like soon all the kids will be using Google Talk&#8217;s video feature. And now more and more laptops have integrated cameras, so people don&#8217;t have to fish around for the dusty webcam in the cabinet.  
I am glad to see that Empathy has finally been accepted as a GNOME module, so my only hope is that by the next GNOME release it will inter-operate with Google&#8217;s application.
