 [<img border="0" align="left" style="margin:5px;float:left;" src="http://static.flickr.com/48/151396021_69917a887c_m_d.jpg" />](http://flickr.com/search/?q=brendabelcher&z=t) I volunteered my apartment for [Brenda&#8217;s CD](http://www.brendabelcher.org) release party. It was wonderfully fun. There were plenty of people that I was waiting for an opportunity to invite them to something, so this helped me too. Brenda&#8217;s performance was great. That photo is from [Daniel Talsky](http://www.tinyplace.org/tinyblog/), he had a front seat.
