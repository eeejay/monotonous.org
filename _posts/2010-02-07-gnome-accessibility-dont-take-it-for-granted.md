I have been on the road for the last two weeks. Headed back to Seattle tomorrow after a great FOSDEM in Brussels.  
While on the road I have heard all sorts of news regarding GNOMEÂ accessibility, none of it good. I am angry, I feel like blaming somebody or something, but I am not sure what. Right now I am directing my frustration towards academics who still have funding to continue various assistive technology research that will probably never see the light of day as a usable application while the real bread and butter of an accessible platform is being taken away. It&#8217;s reflexive, I know it. Maybe later I will have a clearer picture of how we move forward.  
Until then, here are some notes from [Joanie](http://blog.grain-of-salt.com/index.php?itemid=394 "Joanie Diggs: Open Letter to Orcle") and [Mike](http://lightvortex.livejournal.com/189257.html "Mike Gorse: on the state of open-source accessibility").  
While my initial reaction was what a damper this is on our first a11y hackfest, I really hope that it will be an opportunity to regroup, have some good discussions, interact with the wider a11y community, and have some business interactions. So please come to San Diego, you know who you are!
